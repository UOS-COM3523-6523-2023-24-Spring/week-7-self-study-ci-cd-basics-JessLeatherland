# Self study for Week 7 (CI/CD Basics)

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install pytest
```

## Task 1

Run the following on the pycharm built-in terminal:

```bash
pytest -v
```

You can see that `test_simple_function2` is failed. Fix the code (line 2 in `main.py`) to make the test case pass.

When it's fixed, push the change to GitHub to see the GitHub Actions in action.

## Task 2

If you uncomment `test_complex_function` in `test_main.py`, you can see that the test case is most likely failed.
This is because the behaviour of `complex_function` is non-deterministic (depending on `random_function`).

Such non-deterministic behaviour is not uncommon in real-world software system.
How can we test such non-deterministic behaviour? Think about this. (No need to implement anything)

Answer: You could use fixed random seeds for the test cases, or if there is some expected average behaviour, you could
run multiple of the same test and perform some statistical analysis to ensure the behaviour is aligning with the expected averages.
